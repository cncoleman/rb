<dt>A la Duseuil</dt>
 	<dd>a French binding style characteristic of the early seventeenth century. Red morocco covers had as their principal decoration an outer three-line frame near the edges, and an inner three-line frame embellished at the corners with fleurons, leaving a space in the center of each cover for the arms of the owner. The style is often erroneously attributed to the eighteenth-century binder Augustin Du Seuil, but it was fashionable forty years before his birth.</dd>
<dt>A la fanfare</dt>
 	<dd>an elaborate style of French binding developed from about 1570-1640. The main features are complex geometrical interlacing ribbons forming compartments of various shapes as well as a multitude of scrolls wreaths sprays and flowers, filling all compartments on back and sides except the central one. The name fanfare derives from a copy of “Les Fanfares et corvées abbadesques des Roule-Bontemps” printed in 1613 and acquired by the bibliophile Charles Nodier in 1829. Nodier asked Thouvenin, a famous Parisian binder, to rebind the book. Thouvenin based his decoration on the style attributed to Nicolas Eve and his workshop (1578-1634). It was from this nineteenth-century invention that the seventeenth-century bindings became known retrospectively as à la fanfare.

The thickness of the layer of ink transferred to the paper is proportionate to the depth of the incised or etched recesses. As distinct from planographic and letterpress printing intaglio plates leave a layer of ink on the paper which can often be felt.</dd>
<dt>Jeweled bindings</dt>
 	<dd>
covers of gold, silver, or silver-gilt, often encrusted with semi-precious stones surrounding a central ivory plaque, were made in Europe to enclose service books for the church from about the sixth century onwards.
